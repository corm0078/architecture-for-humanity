<h4>Brand New Community Center Opens in Roškovce, Slovakia</h4>
	<h5>December 9, 2014</h5>
		<p>On Tuesday December 9th, the village of Roškovce in Slovakia opened a brand new community
		center. Connected to the local primary school, the new building hosts a community space, small
		kitchen and a classroom upstairs.</p>

		<p>This remote village is home to around 500 Roma people, half of whom are children. The majority
		of adults are unemployed. The small yet vital existing community center was an important place for
		this community, but it was in such a dilapidated state that it was very difficult for functional
		use. Thanks to support from Enel Cuore, the local NGO People in Need will now be able to run its
		health, education and employment programs in a brand new space, and better assist the integration
		of the Roma community into Slovakian society.</p>

		<p>Once the building was completed, a workshop was held with the children and youth of the community
		to envision the internal spatial layout and furniture. The group thought about how to use the space
		in a multitude of different ways. Smaller activity spaces were created with various furniture layouts,
		podiums and carpets. Most of the furniture was built from scratch by the group of architects who
		organized the workshop. The final result is a colorful, vibrant and happy place.</p>

		<p>We would like to thank Enel Cuore for making this possible. And deep thanks to local architect,
		Boris Hochel for designing and managing construction of the building, to People in Need and to the
		community of Obec Spišsky Hrhov for their additional support. A big congrats to everybody involved
		in the project.</p>

<h4>Haiti Program Completion for End of Year</h4>
	<h5>November 4, 2014</h5>
		<p>“Architecture for Humanity’s work in Haiti highlights the extraordinary heights that can be
		reached when an international NGO embraces a local community of architects and builders and commits
		to making life better, instead of just making the papers.  Architecture for Humanity’s five year
		effort in Haiti represents the sacrifice, goodwill and commitment of thousands – from Haiti and
		from abroad – to a better future through design.”</p>

		<p>--Eric Cesal, Executive Director, Architecture for Humanity</p>

		<p>Today we announce the completion of our Haiti program effective January 2015, marking five years
		f commitment to help the people of Haiti rebuild their communities and lives.</p>

		<p>Since we arrived in Haiti in March 2010, Architecture for Humanity has provided post earthquake
		design, planning, construction, training and hundreds of jobs for local Haitians. Our Haiti-based
		team has included architects, urban planners, construction workers, designers, design fellows and
		hundreds of volunteers.</p>

		<p>Over the last five years, Architecture for Humanity has positively affected over 1 million
		Haitians currently living in Haiti. We completed the construction of and opened 13 school projects,
		ssisting over 18,000 students and their families. Our five years of work in Haiti includes the
		completion of nearly 50 projects involving hundreds of structures: homes, medical clinics, offices,
		and schools. We also executed extensive planning and mapping for numerous additional projects and
		were able to train and employ hundreds of Haitians with proper building techniques.</p>

		<p>Even though our organization will no longer have a physical office in Haiti after the new year,
		we will continue to work with partners locally to provide further consultation and work as needed.
		We are committed to finishing all of our ongoing work in Haiti on schedule.</p>

		<p>We are grateful for all of our wonderful donors, friends, volunteers and partners over the last
		five years that have made our work possible, and we are proud that our work in Haiti has positively
		mpacted over 1 million Haitians.</p>

		<p>"By combining multiple design and construction services under one roof, the Haiti Rebuilding
		Center acted as a focal point for practitioners. I will always be proud of the work and the people
		at The Rebuilding Center. The schools we completed proved that Haitian solutions and tradesmen can
		very effectively produce beautiful learning environments while the community planning projects
		helped local communities to have their voices heard in the decision making process."</p>

<h4>What's Ahead: Hurricane Sandy Reconstruction</h4>
	<h5>October 29, 2014</h5>
		<p>Since we started our first year of aid in the Tri-State area, we discovered that as a region,
		the devastation left by the storm exposed the fragility of our built environment – how prepared or
		unprepared we were in our properties, our neighborhoods, and our selves. We have seen the large-scale
		destruction of homes, businesses, streets, and communities.</p>

		<p>More importantly though as we remember today, is that we have moved from recovery to reconstruction.
		No longer are we “victims” of Sandy’s wrath. We continue to actively seek opportunities to guide and
		create a better built environment for those that call this region home.</p>

		<p>In the coming months, the Hurricane Sandy Reconstruction program will continue to support and
		provide resources within our abilities to more property owners, organizations, and municipalities
		to create sustainable, mitigated, adapted, resilient, and timeless homes, businesses, and communities.
		Will continue to explore new and enhance current relationships with like-minded partners to truly make
		his a place to call home.</p>

		<p>As we look ahead, we also want to celebrate a year of reflection, learning, and progress. We set
		t to focus on the vulnerable communities and demographics with the greatest need for design and
		construction services.  Using the power of design to rebuild sustainably and more resiliently, we
		completed several components of our initial goals:</p>

			<p>Early in 2014, we completed our pilot program of the Sandy Design Help Desk.  Starting in
			Far Rockaway, Queens, and ending in Red Hook, Brooklyn, we offered free design consultations
			to a wide variety of property owners.  The consultations offered owners the opportunity to meet
			with the design professionals that we trained in resilient, sustainable design methodology to
			provide opportunities to reconstruct their homes and businesses in a responsible manner.</p>

			<p>In late May and early June, our design and construction teams broke ground at Toms River
			High School North (Toms River, New Jersey) and Washington School (Little Ferry, New Jersey),
			respectively.  The construction teams progressed through the summer months and, in early
			September, completed the reconstruction work on time and on budget.</p>

			<p>After this summer’s tourist season ended, we started construction on the sunshade structures
			on Seaside Heights’ historic boardwalk.  These structures were designed with resilience and
			timeless thought and are now complete.</p>

			<p>In the spring of this year, we authored and launched our Resilience through Education and
			Design Centers.  Focusing on assisting small property owners still recovering from the effects
			of Sandy, the program offers free design consultations through a design clinic where responsible,
			silient, and sustainable solutions are offered.  The second phase of the program affords a client
			to receive pro bono design and construction services in reconstructing their property.</p>

			<p>We have made great strides in identifying and collaborating with new partner organizations,
			as well as enhancing our existing relationships toward a common goal: to assist the people who
			live and work around New York City and the Tri-State region to create a more resilient network
			of communities for generations to come.</p>

			<p>We have identified that there remains a significant need in the region for our services.
			Too many people still have difficulty asking the question, “How do I begin to think about
			rebuilding, let alone do it, and protect my home and family from future storms?” There are
			thousands of property owners who still need that question answered. We continue to receive
			compelling stories from individual property owners seeking sources to reconstruct their homes
			and businesses.</p>
