<h2>Disaster Reconstruction</h2>
	<p>We are a leader in creating responses to disaster reconstruction that go
	beyond the “one and done” projects that leave communities vulnerable to future
	crises. Instead, we focus on creating long-term solutions in partnership with the
	affected communities.

	<h3> Mitazono Wakaba Kindergarten</h3>
		<h4>Tohoku Earthquake Tsunami Rebuilding</h4>
			<p>Mitazono Wakaba Kindergarten has been providing high-quality early-childhood
			education to families in the town of Natori, Japan for more than 60 years.</p>

			<p>Fortunately, most students and staff had left the school before the building
			was swept away by the tsunami. Sadly, four students and one teacher were lost to
			the quake in their own homes.</p>

			<p>As part of the MakiBiz RFP program, we provided the kindergarten with
			construction funding and architectural and business advice to build back better.
			Opening its doors in April 2014 to a fresh group of students, this new building
			provides the kindergarten with a fun space for playing and learning.</p>

	<h3>Maria Auxiliadora School</h3>
		<h4>Happy Hearts Program</h4>
			<p>The 7.9-magnitude earthquake that struck Calderones, Peru, in 2007 heavily
			damaged the original Maria Auxiliadora School. The school was forced to partially
			relocate to temporary classrooms offsite, and half of the campus remained condemned.
			The only school play space was across a recently paved road near a damaged building
			that could collapse in another earthquake.</p>

			<p>Architecture for Humanity held multiple workshops with students, teachers and
			community members in order to assess priorities and ambitions and develop thorough
			ecommendations for reconstruction. The reconstructed school contains innovative
			spaces and resources for students, including a library, a computer lab, and an
			outdoor performance space.</p>

	<h3>Kitakami "We Are One" Market and Youth Center</h3>
		<h4>Tohoku Earthquake Tsunami Rebuilding</h4>
			<p>Located along the jagged Tohoku coastline, the Kitakami community was deeply
			impacted by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Displaced families were moved into
			temporary housing, and three schools were consolidated into one. Residents lacked
			access to fresh food, and the local farming industry no longer had a market at
			which to sell their harvest.</p>

			<p>Community leader Naomi Sato proposed the "We Are One" Market and Youth Center to
			address the area's post-disaster needs. Completed in January 2013, the center is
			a true hub for the community, with a robust calendar of events and classes. The
			market, which provides fresh local produce to the community, now employs four
			Kitakami mothers - who can easily supervise their children thanks to an adjacent
			play area.</p>

	<h3>Collège Mixte Le Bon Berger</h3>
		<h4>Haiti Rebuilding Center</h4>
			<p>Located in the small community of Montrouis, Haiti, Collège Mixte Le Bon Berger
			eaches 400 students from grades one through twelve Architecture for Humanity
			facilitated the design and construction of the school, employing local contractors
			and setting construction standards.</p>

			<p>When we visited the school in 2010, structural deficiencies due to faulty
			construction methods were apparent. Most of the original, unsafe buildings were
			demolished, and in February 2012, a new eight-classroom building was completed.
			The building uses sustainable design methods to allow natural ventilation and
			light into each classroom.</p>

	<h3>Parker House (Biloxi Model Homes)</h3>
		<h4>Biloxi Model Homes Program</h4>
			<p>Karen Parker was in the process of moving when her home was destroyed by
			Hurricane Katrina. This unfortunate timing made her ineligible for aid, as she
			could not prove she was an owner-occupant of the house when Katrina struck.</p>

			<p>As part of the Biloxi Model Homes program, Architecture for Humanity paired
			the Parker family with architect Brett Zamore and provided design services and
			financial assistance for the construction of the Parkers' new home. The architect
			orked closely with Karen to design a house that met the needs of her family of seven.
			mplementing hurricane-resistant construction, the house draws upon regional building
			typologies, and sits above flood-hazard levels.</p>

	<h3>Park for All in Kamaishi</h3>
		<h4>Tohoku Earthquake Tsunami Rebuilding</h4>
			<p>The city of Kamaishi in Iwate became well-known from the story of the "Miracle
			f Kamaishi." Students of Kamaishi East Junior High School ran from their school to
			higher ground after the 2011 earthquake, leading students of the neighboring
			Unosumai Elementary School by holding their hands and encouraging them to stay
			together. Most of the students survived because they remembered what they were
			taught during the earthquake and tsunami drill they have each year. KYSIN-no-kai
			and Architecture for Humanity provided these two schools with hope for their future
			hrough a baseball field and community house. </p>

			<p>This project was designed by 2013 Pritzker Architectural Prize winner, Toyo Ito
			and his staff at Toyo Ito Associates & Architects (TIAA). The clubhouse is equipped
			ith a community room, locker rooms and a storage on the first floor, and an open-air
			bullpen / a spectator area on the second floor.</p>

	<h3>Sandy Design Help Desk</h3>
		<h4>Hurricane Sandy Reconstruction</h4>
			<p>Many of those affected by Hurricane Sandy continue to struggle to rebuild their
			lives. Some remain displaced or live in substandard conditions, while others are
			stuck mid-repair, having exhausted all insurance funds and personal resources.</p>

			<p>Architecture for Humanity has partnered with community organizations to host a
			series of Sandy Design Help Desks in affected communities. The Design Help Desk
			provides residents with free design and technical consultation from industry
			professionals to aid in the rebuilding process. Consultations include reviewing
			architectural drawings, creating design options, conveying building code and flood
			zone information, providing information on recovery programs, and other technical
			assistance to help build resiliently.</p>

	<h3>Maeami-hama Community House</h3>
		<h4>Tohoku Earthquake Tsunami Rebuilding</h4>
			<p>In Maeami-hama, a remote fishing village in Japan, 35 out of 40 homes were
			destroyed by the 2011 tsunami. </p>

			<p>Architecture for Humanity worked with the design firm KMDW and the nine members
			of the Maeami-hama Reconstruction Project Team to build a community center that
			would provide a space for events as well as support the fishermen's livelihood.</p>

			<p>For construction, KMDW developed numbered, interlocking plywood pieces accompanied
			by simple assembly instructions. With these materials, the community team assembled
			the building over a period of a few weeks, with minimal reliance on skilled builders
			or complicated equipment.</p>

	<h3>Ohya Green Sports Park</h3>
		<h4>Tohoku Earthquake Tsunami Rebuilding</h4>
		<p>Following the devastating tsunami, school playgrounds were re-purposed as sites for
		temporary housing, leaving schoolchildren with limited access to sports. Ryuichi Onodera,
		a local rice and asparagus farmer and founder of the community's Junior Sports Club,
		began to dream of donating his idle farmland overlooking a beautiful beach, to build a
		sports park for the local children. Our design fellow came across him, heard his dream,
		and the Ohya Green Sports Park project began.</p>

		<p>The project incorporates natural and recycled materials as much as possible. Poles
		for netting are wooden utility poles. Netting work is executed by former fishermen with
		metal clips used for fishing, while natural turf for the pitch was placed by the help of
		FC Ohya members and local community members. Audience seating and signage are designed
		by a local artist, and built with massive and wildly curved beams of a Japanese traditional
		house hit by the tsunami. Beams tied together and placed in the center of the park to form
		unique a seating structure that symbolizes the reunion of the community and a ship for a
		new start.</p>

<h2>Active Spaces</h2>
	<p>We create engaging community-centered active spaces to support overall well-being by
	combining community programs and services with the natural human love for sport. Our projects
	in developed countries address the growing obesity crises, while our projects in undeveloped
	countries work to address other health concerns.</p>

		<h3>Manica Football for Hope Centre</h3>
			<h4>Football for Hope</h4>
				<p>The Manica Football for Hope Centre creates a new community space while catalyzing
				new building industries in the community.</p>

				<p>The Grupo Desportivo de Manica (GDM) was founded in Mozambique with the hope that
				a public sports organization could encourage social cohesion and reduce poverty.
				Beginning in 2006, GDM partnered with the Football for Hope program to build a new
				headquarters.</p>

				<p>The Manica Football for Hope Centre incorporates modern and traditional construction
				techniques, including traditional compressed earth blocks, which reduce the need for
				lumber and limit deforestation. The building employs sustainable design methods,
				incorporating natural air ventilation in its design. The center provides a new space
				for GDM’s various health, wellness, and learning programs, which are empowering Manicans
				to live happy, healthy lives.</p>

		<h3>Kimisagara Football for Hope Centre</h3>
			<h4>Football for Hope Program</h4>
				<p>In a country torn apart by genocide, the award-winning Kimisagara Centre uses football
				to catalyze social reconciliation.</p>

				<p>The Kigali nonprofit, Esperance unites the Rwandan population through education and
				social programs, including the program, “Football for Peace and Anti-AIDS.” Following the
				1994 genocide, Esperance decided to use football as a tool for reconciliation. Here at
				this centre, the organization also provides life-skills training and education for Rwandan
				youth. </p>

				<p>The centre is located in the heart of the Kimisagara valley, the most densely populated
				and disadvantaged area in central Kigali. The project was completed using passive cooling
				techniques and locally fired clay brick. Rainwater catchment and filtration provides water
				for drinking, washing, flushing toilets, and irrigation. Solar-powered LEDs light the field.</p>

		<h3>Mahiga High Rainwater Court</h3>
			<h4>Nike GAMECHANGERS</h4>
				<p>A multi-purpose, full-size basketball court designed for the St. Joseph Mahiga Primary
				School and the community of Nyeri, Kenya.</p>

				<p>The structure serves multiple functions for the school, acting as a sports facility,
				performance space, classroom and dining area. For the community, it provides the area's
				only community meeting space and hosts their farmer's market.</p>

				<p>The building additionally serves as a major source of fresh water with its rainwater
				collection system. The metal roof covering the 2,500 sq ft court, collects an estimated
				40,000 liters of water per year. This water is funneled to the rainwater storage tanks
				with an integrated UV purification system that has the capacity to store 25,000 liters
				of water. In an area without electricity, the building's solar panels provide energy for
				the water system, as well as night lighting.</p>

		<h3>Manhattan Bridge Skatepark</h3>
			<h4>Nike GAMECHANGERS</h4>
				<p>Located in New York City's Lower East Side under the Manhattan Bridge, the Manhattan
				Bridge Skatepark (aka L.E.S. Skatepark) is one of the most heavily trafficked skateparks
				in the five boroughs. While popular among skateboarders, this park was too neglected to
				serve anyone else's needs.</p>

				<p>In summer 2012, we gave the skatepark a major facelift. Through a Nike GAMECHANGERS
				grant, we worked with community skate advocate Steve Rodriguez (5boro Skateboards),
				California Skateparks, the NYC Department of Parks & Recreation, stakeholders, and
				community members on a design that has revamped and reramped the existing facility.
				New dog runs and community areas will soon be enhancing this public space.</p>

		<h3>Park for All in Kamaishi</h3>
			<h4>Tohoku Earthquake Tsunami Rebuilding</h4>
				<p>The city of Kamaishi in Iwate became well-known from the story of the "Miracle of
				Kamaishi." Students of Kamaishi East Junior High School ran from their school to higher
				ground after the 2011 earthquake, leading students of the neighboring Unosumai Elementary
				School by holding their hands and encouraging them to stay together. Most of the students
				survived because they remembered what they were taught during the earthquake and tsunami
				drill they have each year. KYSIN-no-kai and Architecture for Humanity provided these two
				schools with hope for their future through a baseball field and community house.</p>

<h2>Community Resilience</h2>
	<p>Too many communities are vulnerable to the effects of disasters due to inadequate safety measures
	n the built environment and a lack of technical understanding. We've learned through our work that
	many tragedies are preventable. We’re providing the training, technical expertise, and the networks
	necessary for local architects to provide the leadership necessary to strengthen their communities.</p>

	<p>We also advocate for humanitarian design through speaking engagements and events, to continue to
	lead the conversation in humanitarian architecture and sustainable development</p>

	<h3>Design Like You Give a Damn: LIVE!</h3>
		<p>Design Like You Give a Damn LIVE! is our one-of-a-kind humanitarian design conference held
		annually. We organize this event around a particular topic each year, bringing together design
		experts and enthusiasts from around the world, to address the challenges and lessons learned in
		their field of work.</p>

		<p>Panel discussions address current humanitarian topics, and small-group workshops allow
		participants to gain hands-on knowledge from experts in diverse fields associated with design.
		Design Open Mic provides an opportunity for humanitarian designers to share their work with the
		public through rapid-pace presentations.</p>

	<h3>AIA / AFH Disaster Grant</h3>
		<h4>National Resiliency Program</h4>
			<p>In 2012, the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and Architecture for Humanity partnered
			to coordinate their local members to develop disaster resiliency locally. The AIA/Architecture
			for Humanity Disaster Response Plan Grant was awarded to five Architecture for Humanity chapters
			and AIA components in Washington, DC, Seattle, New York, Baltimore, and Chicago.</p>

			<p>The grant winners have exercised leadership through local projects and workshops, initiating
			partnerships with nonprofits and government agencies, and recruiting teams of architects interested
			 resilience. These chapters are committed to working in tandem with a vast network of government
			 offices, nonprofits, and professional organizations to build capacity and knowledge in disaster
			 response.</p>

	<h3>Green Schools</h3>
		<p>We all aspire to build healthy, inspiring and sustainable schools for the next generation.
		Despite this shared vision, our schools face significant barriers to becoming truly green learning
		nvironments. More than ever, outdated school buildings are unhealthy. Budgets are strapped.
		Educators are too burdened to teach the 'big picture' thinking that students need to live
		sustainable lives. How can we work together so that every student attends a green school?</p>

		<p>Most designers are eager to help improve school facilities. Yet complicated budgetary issues
		prevent building improvements from taking place. As a result, our schools and students suffer
		from chronic underinvestment. We're here to fix that. Architecture for Humanity and its partners
		are helping schools go green by pairing finance and learning programs with inspired, youth-led
		design. We're equipping schools to save cash, save the environment, and train the next generation
		of sustainability 'do-ers'.</p>

	<h3>The APIS Project</h3>
		<h4>Pillars of Sustainable Education</h4>
			<p>“APIS,” the scientific name for the bee is a tribute to and a call for collaboration.
			Starting in 2010, university professors, students and Eldorado community leaders and residents
			have been working together to address post-flood-related issues. For this project, the university
			will design and build temporary and portable ablution blocks for public use in post-disaster
			situations.</p>

			<p>Community members have asked for more training and income-generating opportunities following
			the massive economic losses of recent major storm events. In response, the project team will
			explore and develop vegetable-based building components made from banana or palm leaves, both
			of which are readily available in the region. This project aims to train local community members
			n the production and use of such products, and inspire the development of new products and
			enterprises.</p>
