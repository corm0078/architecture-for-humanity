            <p>We are a leader in creating responses to disaster reconstruction that go beyond the “one and done” projects that leave communities vulnerable to future crises. Instead, we focus on creating long-term solutions in partnership with the affected communities.

            <p>We create engaging community-centered active spaces to support overall well-being by combining community programs and services with the natural human love for sport.

        </div>
            <p>Too many communities are vulnerable to the effects of disasters due to inadequate safety measure. The built environment and a lack of technical understanding. We've learned through our work that many tragedies are preventable. We’re providing the training, technical expertise, and the networks necessary for local architects to provide the leadership necessary to strengthen their communities.</p>

                                <p>Following Hurricane Katrina, Architecture for Humanity worked throughout the Gulf Coast to help families repair and rebuild their homes. The goal of the Biloxi Model Home program was to provide the city's affected families with design services and financial assistance for the construction of new homes. Each family was paired with a team of professional designers; they all worked together to design a new home that was not only affordable, but also sustainable and in line with the area's new building codes.</p>

                                <p>As a legacy of the 2010 Football World Cup, FIFA and streetfootballworld launched the Football for Hope program, with the aim of building 20 centers across Africa. The centers are managed by local NGOs, each having a specific program. All centers address health and education issues using soccer as a tool for development. Architecture for Humanity joined the program to manage the design and construction of the community centers and the building of the soccer pitches. By having a professional architect at each project location, working hand in hand with local consultants and the community, Architecture for Humanity developed 20 unique projects, each one specifically designed to fit the local context and answer the community’s needs.</p>

The projects strengthened underprivileged communities that have been affected by natural disasters. Six schools in Mexico, Chile, and Peru were partially or wholly redesigned and rebuilt. Through community participatory workshops and design charrettes we co-developed new school designs that incorporated each school’s highest priorities, and resulted in safe, comfortable and delightful spaces for a new generation of learners.</p>

                                    <p>In the closing days of October 2012, Hurricane Sandy carved a path through the Caribbean before moving up the Atlantic and turning inland at New Jersey, striking many coastal towns. The storm moved north and created a storm surge that devastated the New York/New Jersey Metro area. The event caused major damage and loss of life.Architecture for Humanity’s reconstruction plan focuses on communities with the greatest need for design and construction services. We believe in rebuilding sustainably and more resiliently to protect these areas from future storms. This program will focus on restoring school sports facilities, and aiding small business and small building owners, as they represent the most affected populations in the region.</p>

                                    <p>The National Resilience Program will assist thousands of people to better prepare their communities to mitigate the impact of future natural disasters. Five regional resilience centers across the United States, operated in partnership with the American Institute of Architects (AIA), Public Architecture, and others, will respond to the threats of natural disasters in five major regions of the United States: Pacific Coast (earthquakes and tsunamis), Gulf Coast (hurricanes and climate change), Midwest (tornadoes and seasonal flooding), Mid-Atlantic (hurricanes), and Northeast (northern storms and urban threats). The program will dovetail with the 100 Resilient Cities Centennial Challenge, which will provide a platform of services for a worldwide network of cities. The Challenge is a formal Clinton Global Initiative Commitment to Action pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation and supported by Architecture for Humanity and others.</p>

                                    <p>Nike GAMECHANGERS is an initiative run by Architecture for Humanity with Nike Social Innovations, as an effort to fund and build sports spaces that are successful catalysts for social change. The intention is to support the raw innovation and creative spirit of projects that don’t often receive support from traditional grants.The Nike GAMECHANGERS grant program encourages community organizations to empower youth. The grant supports sports programs that spur social and economic development in a community, while allowing the design and construction of innovative facilities. Projects may be located in rural, semi-rural or urban areas; they may have singular goals or have multiple functions.Through skills training and workshops, the projects are built with the help of the local community, designers and students. The design team trains builders in indigenous building techniques, using local materials and resources, while also providing the technical guidance to learn from traditional methods in innovative ways.</p>

This cross-sector collaboration between Alcoa, Alcoa Foundation, Architecture for Humanity and seven universities in five countries will work to educate the next generation of architects, engineers and material designers while supporting real-world design-build projects that positively impact both the environment and the local community. Pillars of Sustainable Education highlights four areas of focus for grant recipients: Education, Sustainable and Integrated Design, Actionable Solutions, and Community Impact. Each university is integrating curriculum on the uses of sustainable materials in building systems and partnering with a local nonprofit organization to take their lessons in material innovation and apply them to real-world projects. The program will assist in sharing research, applications and materials across both professional and academic channels: ultimately, it will support the realization of real-world community-based projects.</p>

                                    <p>Architecture for Humanity is collaborating with local design and construction professionals to reconstruct the northern region of Japan, where the earthquake and tsunami hit on March 11, 2011. It has been three years since the disaster, but many communities still need assistance in long-term reconstruction. Recovery from disaster requires a holistic approach. The integration of construction services with business support services is key to the long-term economic recovery of the region. Makibiz, our regional office in Japan, provides design, construction, and business development services to communities in the Tohoku region. This year we will look beyond "post-disaster reconstruction," and continue working with people who are building an active and resilient future of Tohoku. We welcome your continuous support and the opportunity to partner with you.</p>
