    <li>
        <h4><i class="icon-reconstruction"></i>Disaster Reconstruction</h4>
            <p>We are a leader in creating responses to disaster reconstruction that go beyond the “one and done” projects that leave communities vulnerable to future crises. Instead, we focus on creating long-term solutions in partnership with the affected communities.
            </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4><i class="icon-spaces"></i>Active Spaces</h4>
            <p>We create engaging community-centered active spaces to support overall well-being by combining community programs and services with the natural human love for sport. Our projects in developed countries address the growing obesity crises, while our projects in undeveloped countries work to address other health concerns.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4><i class="icon-community"></i>Community Resilience</h4>
            <p>Too many communities are vulnerable to the effects of disasters due to inadequate safety measure. The built environment and a lack of technical understanding. We've learned through our work that many tragedies are preventable. We’re providing the training, technical expertise, and the networks necessary for local architects to provide the leadership necessary to strengthen their communities.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4><i class="icon-education"></i>Education Spaces</h4>
        <p>Working with the local community, we design and build innovative educational spaces that encourage learning and fosters pride in the community. Each project creates a safe place for students to learn, giving them a better future that will continue to impact the economic and social viability of the region.</p>

            <h4>Tohoku Earthquake Tsunami Rebuilding</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mitazono Wakaba Kindergarten has been providing high-quality early-childhood education to families in the town of Natori, Japan for more than 60 years.</li>
                    <li>As part of the MakiBiz RFP program, we provided the kindergarten with construction funding and architectural and business advice to build back better. Opening its doors in April 2014 to a fresh group of students, this new building provides the kindergarten with a fun space for playing and learning.</li>
                    <li>In Maeami-hama, a remote fishing village in Japan, 35 out of 40 homes were destroyed by the 2011 tsunami. </li>
                    <li>Architecture for Humanity worked with the design firm KMDW and the nine members of the Maeami-hama Reconstruction Project Team to build a community center that would provide a space for events as well as support the fishermen's livelihood.</li>
                    <li>For construction, KMDW developed numbered, interlocking plywood pieces accompanied by simple assembly instructions. With these materials, the community team assembled the building over a period of a few weeks, with minimal reliance on skilled builders or complicated equipment.</li>
                </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Happy Hearts Program</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The 7.9-magnitude earthquake that struck Calderones, Peru, in 2007 heavily damaged the original Maria Auxiliadora School. The school was forced to partially relocate to temporary classrooms offsite, and half of the campus remained condemned.The only school play space was across a recently paved road near a damaged building that could collapse in another earthquake.</li>
                    <li>Architecture for Humanity held multiple workshops with students, teachers and community members in order to assess priorities and ambitions and develop thorough ecommendations for reconstruction. The reconstructed school contains innovative spaces and resources for students, including a library, a computer lab, and an outdoor performance space.</li>
                </ul>

            <h4>Tohoku Earthquake Tsunami Rebuilding</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Located along the jagged Tohoku coastline, the Kitakami community was deeply impacted by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Displaced families were moved into temporary housing, and three schools were consolidated into one. Residents lacked access to fresh food, and the local farming industry no longer had a market at which to sell their harvest.</li>
                    <li>Community leader Naomi Sato proposed the "We Are One" Market and Youth Center to address the area's post-disaster needs. Completed in January 2013, the center is a true hub for the community, with a robust calendar of events and classes. The market, which provides fresh local produce to the community, now employs four Kitakami mothers — who can easily supervise their children thanks to an adjacent play area.</li>
                    <li>Following the devastating tsunami, school playgrounds were re-purposed as sites for temporary housing, leaving schoolchildren with limited access to sports. Ryuichi Onodera, a local rice and asparagus farmer and founder of the community's Junior Sports Club, began to dream of donating his idle farmland overlooking a beautiful beach, to build a sports park for the local children. Our design fellow came across him, heard his dream, and the Ohya Green Sports Park project began.</li>
                    <li>The project incorporates natural and recycled materials as much as possible. Poles for netting are wooden utility poles. Netting work is executed by former fishermen with metal clips used for fishing, while natural turf for the pitch was placed by the help of FC Ohya members and local community members. Audience seating and signage are designed by a local artist, and built with massive and wildly curved beams of a Japanese traditional house hit by the tsunami. Beams tied together and placed in the center of the park to form unique a seating structure that symbolizes the reunion of the community and a ship for a new start.</li>
                    <li>The city of Kamaishi in Iwate became well-known from the story of the "Miracle of Kamaishi." Students of Kamaishi East Junior High School ran from their school to higher ground after the 2011 earthquake, leading students of the neighboring Unosumai Elementary School by holding their hands and encouraging them to stay together. Most of the students survived because they remembered what they were taught during the earthquake and tsunami drill they have each year. KYSIN-no-kai and Architecture for Humanity provided these two schools with hope for their future through a baseball field and community house.</li>
                    <li>This project was designed by 2013 Pritzker Architectural Prize winner, Toyo Ito and his staff at Toyo Ito Associates &amp; Architects (TIAA). The clubhouse is equipped with a community room, locker rooms and a storage on the first floor, and an open-air bullpen a spectator area on the second floor.</p>

            <h4>Haiti Rebuilding Center</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Located in the small community of Montrouis, Haiti, Collège Mixte Le Bon Berger eaches 400 students from grades one through twelve Architecture for Humanity facilitated the design and construction of the school, employing local contractorsand setting construction standards.</li>
                    <li>When we visited the school in 2010, structural deficiencies due to faulty construction methods were apparent. Most of the original, unsafe buildings were demolished, and in February 2012, a new eight-classroom building was completed.The building uses sustainable design methods to allow natural ventilation and light into each classroom.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Biloxi Model Homes Program</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Karen Parker was in the process of moving when her home was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. This unfortunate timing made her ineligible for aid, as she could not prove she was an owner-occupant of the house when Katrina struck.</li>
                    <li>As part of the Biloxi Model Homes program, Architecture for Humanity paired the Parker family with architect Brett Zamore and provided design services and financial assistance for the construction of the Parkers' new home. The architect worked closely with Karen to design a house that met the needs of her family of seven. Emplementing hurricane-resistant construction, the house draws upon regional building typologies, and sits above flood-hazard levels.</li>
                </ul>

        <div>
            <h4>Hurricane Sandy Reconstruction</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Many of those affected by Hurricane Sandy continue to struggle to rebuild their lives. Some remain displaced or live in substandard conditions, while others are stuck mid-repair, having exhausted all insurance funds and personal resources.</li>
                    <li>Architecture for Humanity has partnered with community organizations to host a series of Sandy Design Help Desks in affected communities. The Design Help Desk provides residents with free design and technical consultation from industry professionals to aid in the rebuilding process. Consultations include reviewing architectural drawings, creating design options, conveying building code and flood zone information, providing information on recovery programs, and other technical assistance to help build resiliently.</li>
                </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Football for Hope</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Manica Football for Hope Centre creates a new community space while catalyzing new building industries in the community.</li>
                    <li>The Grupo Desportivo de Manica (GDM) was founded in Mozambique with the hope that a public sports organization could encourage social cohesion and reduce poverty. Beginning in 2006, GDM partnered with the Football for Hope program to build a newheadquarters.</p>
                    <li>The Manica Football for Hope Centre incorporates modern and traditional construction techniques, including traditional compressed earth blocks, which reduce the need for lumber and limit deforestation. The building employs sustainable design methods, incorporating natural air ventilation in its design. The center provides a new space for GDM’s various health, wellness, and learning programs, which are empowering Manicans to live happy, healthy lives.</li>
                    <li>In a country torn apart by genocide, the award-winning Kimisagara Centre uses football to catalyze social reconciliation.</li>
                    <li>The Kigali nonprofit, Esperance unites the Rwandan population through education and social programs, including the program, “Football for Peace and Anti-AIDS.” Following the 1994 genocide, Esperance decided to use football as a tool for reconciliation. Here at this centre, the organization also provides life-skills training and education for Rwandanyouth. </li>
                    <li>The centre is located in the heart of the Kimisagara valley, the most densely populated and disadvantaged area in central Kigali. The project was completed using passive cooling techniques and locally fired clay brick. Rainwater catchment and filtration provides water for drinking, washing, flushing toilets, and irrigation. Solar-powered LEDs light the field.</li>

            <h4>Nike GAMECHANGERS</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A multi-purpose, full-size basketball court designed for the St. Joseph Mahiga Primary School and the community of Nyeri, Kenya.</li>
                    <li>The structure serves multiple functions for the school, acting as a sports facility, performance space, classroom and dining area. For the community, it provides the area's only community meeting space and hosts their farmer's market.</li>
                    <li>The building additionally serves as a major source of fresh water with its rainwater collection system. The metal roof covering the 2,500 sq ft court, collects an estimated 40,000 liters of water per year. This water is funneled to the rainwater storage tanks with an integrated UV purification system that has the capacity to store 25,000 liters of water. In an area without electricity, the building's solar panels provide energy for the water system, as well as night lighting.</li>
                    <li>Located in New York City's Lower East Side under the Manhattan Bridge, the Manhattan Bridge Skatepark (aka L.E.S. Skatepark) is one of the most heavily trafficked skateparks in the five boroughs. While popular among skateboarders, this park was too neglected to serve anyone else's needs.</li>
                    <li>In summer 2012, we gave the skatepark a major facelift. Through a Nike GAMECHANGERS grant, we worked with community skate advocate Steve Rodriguez (5boro Skateboards), California Skateparks, the NYC Department of Parks & Recreation, stakeholders, and community members on a design that has revamped and reramped the existing facility. New dog runs and community areas will soon be enhancing this public space.</li>
                </ul>

            <h4>National Resiliency Program</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>In 2012, the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and Architecture for Humanity partnered to coordinate their local members to develop disaster resiliency locally. The AIA/Architecture for Humanity Disaster Response Plan Grant was awarded to five Architecture for Humanity chapters and AIA components in Washington, DC, Seattle, New York, Baltimore, and Chicago.</li>
                    <li>The grant winners have exercised leadership through local projects and workshops, initiating partnerships with nonprofits and government agencies, and recruiting teams of architects interested resilience. These chapters are committed to working in tandem with a vast network of government offices, nonprofits, and professional organizations to build capacity and knowledge in disaster response.</li>

            <h4>Pillars of Sustainable Education</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>“APIS,” the scientific name for the bee is a tribute to and a call for collaboration. Starting in 2010, university professors, students and Eldorado community leaders and residents have been working together to address post-flood-related issues. For this project, the university will design and build temporary and portable ablution blocks for public use in post-disaster situations.</li>
                    <li>Community members have asked for more training and income-generating opportunities following the massive economic losses of recent major storm events. In response, the project team will explore and develop vegetable-based building components made from banana or palm leaves, both of which are readily available in the region. This project aims to train local community members and the production and use of such products, and inspire the development of new products and enterprises.</li>
